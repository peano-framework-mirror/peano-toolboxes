/**
 * Encapsulates Smoothness-Based Refinement and Coarsening
 *
 * To use this class, you have to do the following operations:
 *
 * - Add your dof a double vector of size dimensions:
\code
  discard parallelise double linearSurplus[DIMENSIONS];
\endcode
 *   This attribute typically is a discard attribute.
 * - Make your PDE-solver/adapter hold an instance of
 *   this class.
 * - Adopt your adapter accordingly:
 *   - beginIteration(): invoke clearMeasurements()
 *   - touchVertexFirstTime(): clear the surplus values of your vertex
 *   - enterCell(): invoke getNewLinearSurplus()
 *   - touchVertexLastTime(): invoke analyse() and getNewLinearSurplusContributionFromFineGrid()

    /**
     * Clear Measurements and Adopt Bins
     *
     * Is typically called by beginIteration(). The workflow is very simple:
     *
     * - Set all the bins either to refine or no operation. Which one to chose
     *   depends on the percentage of vertices to refine. We start with the
     *   biggest bin and then count down, while we analyse how many vertices
     *   belonged into which bin in the last iteration.
     * - Traverse the bins once more starting with the smallest bin. Reset the
     *   no-action bins to delete if vertices are to be deleted.
     *
     * If a bin has been set to refine first and afterwards to delete, there's
     * obviously a conflict: A bin has to be both a refine and a delete bin. In
     * this case, the bin is set to no-operation. The only exception is bins
     * whose range is smaller than _minimumSurplus. Those are always flagged
     * with delete.
     *
     * Finally, the operation logs the statistics due to logStatistics() and
     * resets all counters.
     *
     * If we didn't set the very first bin to delete, applications with a very
     * smooth solution yielding a regular grid and a permanently decreasing
     * solution fail: Here, the surpluses become smaller and smaller.
     * Consequently, also the binned interval becomes smaller. At the same time,
     * only the fine grid vertices fall into bin zero. Now, at some point all the
     * coarse grid points wander into bin 0 as the minimal bin size constraint of
     * rescaleSurplusMaximum() starts to hold. As the algorithm still tries to
     * refine, now bin(0) is set to no-action even though the solution is extremely
     * smooth and small. So I decided to make bin(0) hold the delete flag always
     * if the algorithm shall delete elements from the grid.
     *

     *
     *
     * !!! The smallest linear surplus
     *
     * For many cooling phenomena, it is important to prescribe a minimum
     * surplus, i.e. each vertex with a surplus smaller than this threshold is
     * deleted. At the same time, this is kind of a magic parameter that
     * influences your refinement pattern dramatically. I suggest to pass here
     * a scaled mesh size, i.e. to take the maximum mesh size (which defines
     * your worst-case accuracy) and to multiply it with the biggest absolute
     * value of the solution ever measured. This ensures that the mesh becomes
     * coarser and coarser if the whole solution disappears. How fast it is
     * coarsed is determined by the maximum mesh size. At the same time, it
     * ensures that very small surpluses do not fall into this category (delete)
     * if the overall solutino already is almost zero and we wanna study the
     * effect of small stimuli.
     *
     * @param minimumSurplus Is the smallest linear surplus that should not be
     *           deleted. Set to zero to switch this off.

     * Analyse a vertex and derive action to be taken
     *
     * Please call this operation solely for inside vertices.
     *
     * !!! Analysis Workflow
     *
     * - Check whether the vertex is refined though the surrounding cells are smaller than the minimum mesh size. If so, coarse it.
     * - Check whether the vertex is unrefined though the surrounding cells are bigger than the maximum mesh size. If so, refine it.
     * - Check whether the vertex holds inf as surplus (see getLinearSurplusContributionFromFineGrid()). If so, leave it as it is.
     * - If all this does not hold:
     *   - Update the local attribute _surplusMaximumOnFineGrid.
     *   - If _surplusMaximumOnFineGrid equals 0.0 jump out of analyser, as in this case we cannot do bin sorting.
     *   - Sort into bin and decide what to do.
     *
     * !!! Comparison Details / Vetos
     *
     * As soon as the right bin has been found, a couple of veto constraints
     * have to be checked:
     *
     * - If refine has been derived for a refined vertex or if delete has been
     *   derived for an unrefined vertex, change action into no action.
     * - If the operation wants to refine but the maximum number of refinements
     *   already has been reached, change the refine command into no action.
     * - Each refine induces a smaller mesh width by a factor of three. If this
     *   mesh width is smaller than the minimum mesh width, reject the
     *   refinement command and change it into no action. For this analysis, we
     *   have to devide the current mesh width by 3.0, as this operation always
     *   is called for an unrefined vertex which then becomes a coarse grid
     *   vertex.
     * - If a delete is derived, this delete is derived for an already refined
     *   vertex. If the adjacent cells have a mesh width that is bigger than
     *   the maximum mesh width, it would not be a good idea to make the mesh
     *   coarser here. In this case, we change the action into no action. For
     *   the check, h does not have to be rescaled.
